## CSS-in-JS: The Future of Component-Based Styling

As the web is moving towards a component based approach, many agree that the limitations of CSS require us to change how we write our styles. CSS-in-JS is one possible solution that enables us to write styles in declarative, maintainable JavaScript.

## Coding Night: CSS Grid

Frank is inviting you back to Die Zentrale for a social coding event! There will be two topics covered at this event, CSS images and CSS grid. For the CSS images part, you will be able to recreate one of Victoriaâ€™s CSS images (we will choose one together). This is a great exercise to improve your overall CSS skills, for example increase efficiency, becoming better at positing and learning new properties.
